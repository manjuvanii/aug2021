1. Create folder 'Test' in your home directory​
 mkdir Test

2. Create below files​
 
  - employeelist​
   touch employeelist​

  - skillset​
     touch skillset
​

3. Create folder Test2 in home directory​
   mkdit Test2

  - create symbolink and hard link for skillset file ​
    ln skillset  hardlink
    ln -s skillset symbolink

  - delete skillset file and check if hardlink and symbolic link file exists​
    rm skillset
    ls -l -i
    cat hardkink
    cat symbolink
    (There will be no error while executing command  cat hardkink
    and error during cat symbolink)

  - explain the difference b/n symbolic and hard links​
    A hard link, then, just creates another file with a link to the same underlying inode.
    A symbolic link is a special file containing a path to another file. It is like a shortcut of the orignal file. 

4. Provide read and write permission to 'user2' group​
test if user2 group users can access the file​
   chmod g+rw employeelist
​

5. Revoke write permission from user2 group and test the access again​
   chmod g-r employeelist


6. Grant write permission for others and test it ​
   chmod o+w employeelist


7. Revoke write permission for others and test again​
   chmod o-w employeelist

8. Change the group of employeelist file to 'user3'​
test if user3 group have access​
    chrgp user3 employeelist

9. Change ownership of the file to user5 and test​
    chown user5 employeelist

10. check how many employees are there  (hint: use wc command)​
    who | wc -l
